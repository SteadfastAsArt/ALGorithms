# Dynamic Programming

## Goal
To avoid naive in tabular memory of states.

## Property
* Optimal Substructure
    * The answer comes from accumulatively summing up the optimal tinies.
* Overlapping Problems
    * Record previous computed states to mitigate unnecessary computation pressure.

## Classics
* LCS
* Knapsack
